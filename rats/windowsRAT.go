/*
The code is written in Go and uses the built-in net package to establish a TCP connection with a Windows computer at the specified IP address and port.

First, the net.Dial function is called with the target IP address and port to initiate the connection. If there is an error, it is printed to the console and the program exits.

Once the connection is established, the program sends a message "Windows Command Shell" to the remote server using the fmt.Fprintln function. Then, a buffer is created with a length of 1024 bytes to receive data from the server.

The program then waits to receive data from the server using the conn.Read function. The data is stored in the buffer, and the number of bytes read is returned. Finally, the program prints the data received from the server to the console.
